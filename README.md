# Causal-Inference-Project


## Description

I want to do a project related to Fantasy Sports, specifically Fantasy
Football. I think it would be cool to do something related to DraftKings
Sunday Millionaire contest to try and see if there is some correlation
between all the winners and where they spent up or spent down at a
position. If I can’t get that data I think something to do with draft
position/draft strategy in a stamdard Fantasy Football League would also
be interesting.

## Project Organization

- `/code` Scripts with prefixes (e.g., `01_import-data.py`,
  `02_clean-data.py`) and functions in `/code/src`.
- `/data` Simulated and real data, the latter not pushed.
- `/figures` PNG images and plots.
- `/output` Output from model runs, not pushed.
- `/presentations` Presentation slides.
- `/private` A catch-all folder for miscellaneous files, not pushed.
- `/writing` Reports, posts, and case studies.
- `/.venv` Hidden project library, not pushed.
- `.gitignore` Hidden Git instructions file.
- `.python-version` Hidden Python version for the reproducible
  environment.
- `requirements.txt` Information on the reproducible environment.

## Reproducible Environment

After cloning this repository, go to the project’s terminal in Positron
and run `python -m venv .venv` to create the `/.venv` project library,
followed by `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the specified
library versions.

Whenever you install new libraries or decide to update the versions of
libraries you use, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to update
`requirements.txt`.
